# Game Backend, Phase 2
This implements a back-end of the Game project using Spring Framework, Hibernate OGM, MongoDB.  
MongoDB was chosen since much of the data in this application does not fit into tables with fixed numbers of columns as are required in relational databases.  

Compilation
-----------------------------
To run this, please install MongoDB on your system and start mongod.exe.
